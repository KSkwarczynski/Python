## Description
**dataSet.ipynb** - Download the data file from: ... and write a program that for every dataset separately calculates: </br>
**Neighbour.ipynb** - We want to use the KNN algorithm for the classification problem. We consider a
training sample of N=10^6 points, which are distributed approximately uniformly on the
available feature space . Calculate the mean distance between neighbors assuming
**kNN.ipynb** - Just kNN implementatios
