## Description
**dataSet.ipynb** - Download the data file from: ... and write a program that for every dataset separately calculates: </br>
**Neighbour.ipynb** - We want to use the KNN algorithm for the classification problem. We consider a
training sample of N=10^6 points, which are distributed approximately uniformly on the
available feature space.</br>
**kNN.ipynb** - Just kNN implementation. </br>
**Normalization_Standarization.ipynb** - Add feature scaling (standardization and normalization) for your k-NN implementation.  </br>
